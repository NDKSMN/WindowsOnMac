here's how to download Windows on a Intel Macbook! In this situation  I'm using a Macbook air 2020 or 2019, who knows?
So to get started you will need to use bootcamp assistant which is available on intel macs only! open it and tap next and before you select anything else then next download windows 10 iso and then when it finishes remember where you saved it so its easier to select it when it asks for the iso pick the windows 10 iso and resize the partition size for each OS make it even or however you want and tap install when youre done. Wait for it to finish it might take up to an hour or two and when it finishes it will restart. When it restarts it should boot into windows.
> NOTE: if it didnt boot into windows then hold option + R, which should boot into boot picker pick windows or if you dont see windows written the search for the bootcamp logo boot into it. 
then set up windows like normal but if it givess an error then that means windows is limited for macs but there is a trick to skip that screen. To bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements during installation when using Boot Camp, you'll need to modify two registry entries: BypassTPMCheck and BypassSecureBootCheck. First, you'll open the Registry Editor (regedit). Then, create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value named "BypassTPMCheck" and set its value to "1". Next, create another DWORD (32-bit) Value named "BypassSecureBootCheck" and set its value to "1". These entries should be placed within the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup registry key. 
Detailed Steps:
Open Registry Editor: Press the Windows key + R, type "regedit", and press Enter, or use the terminal.
Navigate to Setup Key: Navigate to the following registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup.
Create BypassTPMCheck: In the Setup key, create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value named "BypassTPMCheck".
Set BypassTPMCheck Value: Double-click the new "BypassTPMCheck" Value and set its value data to "1".
Create BypassSecureBootCheck: In the Setup key, create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value named "BypassSecureBootCheck".
Set BypassSecureBootCheck Value: Double-click the new "BypassSecureBootCheck" Value and set its value data to "1".Restart: Restart your computer for the changes to take effect. After that it should work and skip the screen. Now set up windows 10 like normal and when youre done download the drivers you will find in the installation disk that you can find removable in file explorer. then after that find the exe app that should be named something like mac drivers, bootcamp or something like that. then after you downloaded the drivers plug in the usb that will have nothing on it if it has something move it on a different one or on a different device.then install winbootmate and download windows 11 iso. plug the usb in and it should show up in the app. there select the windows 11 iso it should install windows 11 on the usb but do not restart the mac to boot off thhe usb instead you need to go to the file explorer selec the usb and tap on setup or install app to update the windows on the existing partition.after that you wait for it to finish the update and you're done!
